VPN Nomade Server Configuration with OpenVPN and Certificate Authority Setup

## Description 
This project aims to establish a secure and flexible nomadic VPN server using OpenVPN, enabling users to connect to their private network from anywhere in the world. By leveraging the robust features of OpenVPN, we will create a reliable and efficient virtual private network that ensures data privacy and security for remote users.

In addition to setting up the VPN server, this project will also involve configuring a simple Certificate Authority (CA). The CA will be responsible for issuing digital certificates that authenticate users and devices connecting to the VPN. This added layer of security will help establish trust between the server and clients, ensuring that only authorized users can access the network.

### Creating the OpenVPN Server and Certificate Authority

1. **Set Up the OpenVPN Server**: 
   - Install OpenVPN on the server.
   - Configure the server settings to establish a secure VPN connection.

2. **Create a Certificate Authority (CA)**: 
   - Set up a simple CA to manage the issuance of digital certificates.
   - Generate the relevant certificates needed for secure communication.

3. **Generate Configuration Files**: 
   - Create the necessary OpenVPN configuration files that define how the server and clients will communicate.

4. **Configure the Host Firewall**: 
   - Adjust the firewall settings on the host to allow VPN traffic and ensure secure connections.

5. **Start the VPN**: 
   - Launch the OpenVPN server to begin accepting connections from clients.

6. **Configure VPN Clients**: 
   - Set up each of the VPN clients that will connect to the server, ensuring they have the correct configuration and certificates.

7. **Connect and Test the VPN Connection**: 
   - Establish a connection from the VPN clients to the server.
   - Test the VPN connection to verify that traffic is being sent and received securely.
