VPN Nomade Server Configuration with OpenVPN and Certificate Authority Setup

## Description 
This project aims to establish a secure and flexible nomadic VPN server using OpenVPN, enabling users to connect to their private network from anywhere in the world. By leveraging the robust features of OpenVPN, we will create a reliable and efficient virtual private network that ensures data privacy and security for remote users.

In addition to setting up the VPN server, this project will also involve configuring a simple Certificate Authority (CA). The CA will be responsible for issuing digital certificates that authenticate users and devices connecting to the VPN. This added layer of security will help establish trust between the server and clients, ensuring that only authorized users can access the network.
